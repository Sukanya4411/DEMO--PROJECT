Answer: d
Explanation: Option 1 + 0(1+0)* → It does not consider even length criteria for the question.
Option (0+1) (1+0)* → It can so happen here that from the former bracket it takes 0 or 1 and takes null from the latter then it forms a string of odd length
Option (1+0) → It gives either 1 or 0.
Hence Option (00+0111+10)* is the answer.
